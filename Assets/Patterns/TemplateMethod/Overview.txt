Template Method Definition
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass, but lets subclass override specific steps
without changing its structure

Simplified - "Parent class decides when things happen, Child class decides 'what' happens."

Why do we want to use it?
We need each step to happen in a specific order, but want to allow user to change what happens
during that 'step'.

Common Examples
Any mechanic that has common setup steps but needs variation on the behavior. 
Enemies, Collectibles, Pickups, etc.
