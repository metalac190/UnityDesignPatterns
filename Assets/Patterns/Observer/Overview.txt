Observer Pattern Definition
An subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them automatically of any state changes
by calling the designated method

Simplified - "Run method in response to this specific event"

Why do we want to use it?
We want to react to things ONLY when they happen, instead of checking every loop to see 'if its happened yet'

Common Examples
User Interface, any time a specific event happens that other things should know about, 'damaged', 'leveled up', etc.
